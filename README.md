# Hub CZN - steve1316 fork

A personal fork of [sostenesfreitas/hub-czn](https://github.com/sostenesfreitas/hub-czn), the gear
optimizer and damage simulator for **Chaos Zero Nightmare**.

This fork exists to harden the capture setup - the part that intercepts the game's traffic to read
your inventory, roster and rescue records. The upstream app worked, but it installed a root
certificate machine-wide with no way to remove it, left an elevated local API open to anything on
the machine, and needed mitmproxy installed separately. Those are the things being fixed here.

Changes are not sent upstream. For what the app does and how to use it, see the upstream README.

## Changelog

### 2026-09-03

- The certificate is now trusted only while a capture is running and untrusted again the moment it
  stops, so nothing is left behind on your machine between sessions.
- You no longer have to permanently trust the certificate before capture will start.
- If the app is closed or crashes mid-capture, it now removes the redirect and the certificate
  itself. Before this the game could not connect until you launched the app again.
- `Setup` now shows a leftover redirect from a previous session with a button to remove it.
- The packaged app could not reach its own API, so `Setup` reported "Could not connect to the API".
  Fixed - it affected every build, not just some machines.
- Stopping a capture on purpose is no longer reported as an unexpected disconnection.
- The `Capture` prerequisite badges now spin while the checks are still running, instead of looking
  like a result.
- The capture region is worked out from the server the game actually connected to.
- An expired certificate is now detected and reported, and `Setup` no longer re-checks it constantly.
- Added `Arabella` and her partner `Licinia`, `Hilde`, and `Fei`, along with portraits for them and
  for `Westmacott`, `Marin`, `Noel` and `Erica`.
- Corrected several wrong stats: the friendship health bonus was short from level four up, health
  potential nodes were worth 8% rather than 3%, and `Arabella` and `Adelheid` grew on the wrong
  curves. Character data is now checked against the game's own files.
- Releases are now built and published from GitHub, and the app checks this fork for updates instead
  of the project it was forked from.

### 2026-09-02

- Forked from upstream `v0.4.6`.
- The CA is now installed for your Windows account only, instead of for every account on the PC.
- `Setup` gained a **Remove** button, and uninstalling the app now untrusts the certificate. Before
  this there was no way to undo it at all.
- Generating the certificate no longer takes three seconds or needs mitmproxy on your PATH.
- The Windows security prompt that appears when trusting the certificate is now visible. It was
  being hidden, which made the app hang and then report a misleading error.
- mitmproxy ships inside the app, so `Setup` no longer asks you to install anything.
- Capture no longer leaves your game unable to connect if the app crashes mid-session - leftover
  redirects are cleaned up the next time it starts.
- Starting capture now reports a real error when it fails. It used to report success regardless.
- The proxy listens on this machine only, rather than accepting connections from the local network.
- The app's local API now requires a token, so another program - or a web page you happen to open -
  can no longer drive it while it is running as administrator.
- The endpoint that could run an elevated `pip install` has been removed.
- Captured account data is excluded from git instead of sitting untracked in the repo.
